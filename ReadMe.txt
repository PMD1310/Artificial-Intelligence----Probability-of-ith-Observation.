How code is structured?
PP.py- Main task of this code is to find out the probability of occurrence of cherry and lime after ith observation. So the code written calculates the probabilty of the current observation based on prior observation and further uses the current observation as prior probabilty for the next one. Finally, finds out the probability of i+1 occurrence of cherry and lime from the given bags

How to run the code?
Change the directory to  Task1 project where PP.py python file is present.
